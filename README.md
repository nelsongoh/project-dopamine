## About the Project

Titled [Project Dopamine](https://proj-dopamine.web.app), this is a personal pet project that was created to practice my web development skill set, while creating individual services to serve friends and family. This project focuses on a web platform which provides individualized pages to the users, providing services which cater to their needs and wants. The content of the project is private (as they belong to friends and family), but currently contains services such as a personalized calendar, and an aromatherapy toolkit.

All views within the platform require user account access, but public user account creation is not currently available, and can only be performed by an administrator.

This project is currently hosted on Google Firebase and runs on its suite of services.

## Features

The features of this project include:

- [x] User account access with email and password login authentication
